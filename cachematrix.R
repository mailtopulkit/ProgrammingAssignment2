## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the 
## inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.The two functions makeCacheMatrix and 
## cacheSolve calculates the inverse of a matrix by caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmatrix <- function(inv) m <<- inv
        getmatrix <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmatrix = setmatrix,
             getmatrix = getmatrix)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        m <- x$getmatrix()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data)
        x$setmatrix(m)
        m
}
